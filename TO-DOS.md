- [x] Find a simple ML use case: only 1 model artifact is needed (no need extra thing like tokenizer/vectorizer)
- [x] Dev: Train and infer locally
- [x] Dev: a local web API with FastAPI, test with a sample client script, write user instruction to use the endpoint
- [x] Dev: make codes production ready
- [x] Build: Containerize the web API, test with client script
- [ ] Deploy: host the container on Azure - ACI, web service, etc.
- [ ] Secure the API by API key or credentials
- [ ] Advanced deployment 1: deploy on AKS with re-create strategy (with downtime)
- [ ] Advanced deployment 2: zero downtime strategies with load-balancer
- [ ] CICD with tests
